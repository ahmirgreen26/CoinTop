# CoinTop
CoinTop is the physical wallet crave and fintech solution the world has yet to have acknowledged.
It serves the ability to act as your wallet, savings account, debit card, and more!
CoinTop is looking to not discrupt the card industry but simply reinvent the wheel as far as card payments are concerned whilst taking advantage of the great world of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.
This platform will issue physical coins with a chip to allow all tap and pay transactions at the nucleus of the coin, wrapped in steel alloy, and designed to replicate your 'Tokard' of choice. A tokard being the first ever token card for up to 30 coins icluding CoinTop. 
CoinTop will have ability to allow purchases using any coin in your portfolio
The tokard will be the length 2 times the size of a quarter with a width of two quarters stacked together. creating ample space in your wallet, or in some cases erasing the need for one.
* I KNOW THERE IS NO GLOBAL USE OF CRYPTO PAYMENT (YET!) 

The user will access their mobile app upon getting ready to make a transaction, select which coin they would like to use for the transaction and the coin will immediately be sold for fiat to complete the transaction for satisfaction from both customer and supplier.
We will eventually have commercial use of 'CoinScanners' to scan a coin and allow user to select which coin they would like to use for their purchases. You can choose the coin from your wallet you would like to spare on the interactive screen displayed by the 'CoinScanner' leaving out need to access mobile wallet.
